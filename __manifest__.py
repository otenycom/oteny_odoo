    "description": """
The generic Odoo side of an Oteny business bot — the layer any Odoo instance installs to host a
bot it talks to over Discuss, independent of any workflow engine or domain.

An Oteny business bot runs on its own isolated machine and reaches this Odoo over a scoped
/json/2/ uplink; because it is external, it writes its activity back here so the bot's owner (an
Odoo user) can review every exchange without leaving Odoo — the same visibility an in-process
ai.agent (Wilma) has natively.

Models: oteny.bot (a bot connected to this Odoo), oteny.bot.session (one request/response
exchange + outcome), oteny.bot.turn (per-LLM-call detail). The record_activity() seam is what the
bot calls over /json/2/ to log an exchange. A session's origin is a soft (model, id) reference, so
a workflow module (riverflow) or an app module attaches its own record without this addon
depending on it.
