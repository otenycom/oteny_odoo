        actually live — the bot's own machine is never asked to police its own admission:

        1. **Somebody actually added it.** A channel carrying ``group_ids`` auto-subscribes
           every member of those groups — Odoo's own mechanism, and how the default

           is not consent; an operator who genuinely wants the bot company-wide adds it to
           a normal channel or binds a role.
        2. **Who put it there.** The channel's creator must hold the Oteny Bot Operator
           group, and must be a *person* — never the bot's own seam login. An ordinary
           internal user cannot conjure a room, drop the bot in, and get an answering agent
           that reads this Odoo through the bot's grants; and since a seam login is normally
           an HR user (which implies the operator group), a bot that talked itself into
           creating a channel would otherwise be admitted into a room of its own making.
        3. **Who can read the answers.** Every member must be an internal user — no portal
           user, no guest. Barney's replies quote employee and client data; a room with an
           outside reader is refused outright rather than quietly served.
